TODO

* Convert all class objects to be of the inside-out variety rather than
hash-based, so to gain rigorous protection against external code directly
accessing our object attributes, and to avoid related maintenance problems.

* Once the above are done, announce Rosetta Developer Release #4.

* Add some actual functionality to SQLParser.pm.  When this happens, also
add an external dependency on something like Parse::RecDescent which will
help implement said functionality.

* Update the Changes file to summarize events prior to 2005-06-25, where
the module existed soley as references in Rosetta::Framework and other
places.  Then update the copyright statement so its first year coincides
with the first mention; for now it is the same date as
Rosetta::Utility::SQLParser, which is probably wrong.

* Make the test suite test more than that the module compiles.

* Any further improvements will be implemented over time as they are
needed. See the separately released "Rosetta-Engine-Generic" and
"Rosetta-Emulator-DBI" distributions for a clue as they are the initial
main dependents of the Rosetta::Utility::SQLParser module.
